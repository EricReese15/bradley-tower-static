# bradley-tower-static

This is the Mayor's Dashboard for the City of Los Angeles. It is a static website - just html pages - built using Sheetsee.js and Tabletop, that requires very little programming or customization to stand up. The data is stored in Google Docs. 

Expect better documentation shortly.

The City of Los Angeles has enhanced this version with some additional functionality, which while technically a bit more tricky, does enable easier content and page management: http://github.com/datala/bradley-tower
